# Nutrition Label

## Description

I built this project to further my understanding of HTML and CSS. 

A nutrition label can help you make healthier eating choices and identify the nutritional value of the associated food or drink.

Things that I learned by completing this project:
- Typography
- Creating a basic Nutrition Facts label

## Usage

This is what the project should look like:
